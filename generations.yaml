    description: "The first-generation Renault Koleos represented Renault's initial entry into the medium SUV segment, developed in collaboration with Nissan and Samsung (Renault's Korean subsidiary). Built on the Nissan C platform shared with the Nissan X-Trail, the Koleos was designed by Renault but manufactured by Renault Samsung Motors in Korea. The exterior design featured a relatively conventional SUV silhouette with Renault's corporate styling elements of the period, including a prominent grille and flared wheel arches. Measuring 4.52 meters in length, the Koleos occupied the mid-size SUV segment with five seats and reasonably generous cargo space of up to 1,380 liters with the rear seats folded. Engine options varied by market but typically included a 2.0-liter gasoline engine with 140 horsepower and a 2.0-liter dCi diesel available in 150 or 175 horsepower variants. Transmission options included six-speed manual and continuously variable automatic transmissions, with both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations available. The all-wheel drive system featured three modes: 2WD, Auto (which distributed torque as needed), and Lock (which maintained a fixed 50:50 torque distribution). The interior offered a functional layout with Renault's typical ergonomics of the period and available features including a Bose sound system, panoramic sunroof, and basic navigation on higher trims. A facelift in 2011 brought revised styling, particularly to the front fascia, along with interior enhancements and equipment upgrades. The first-generation Koleos achieved modest sales success in Europe but found stronger markets in regions like Asia and South America where demand for mid-size SUVs was growing rapidly."

    description: "The second-generation Renault Koleos, introduced in 2016, marked a significant step up in size, quality, and positioning within Renault's lineup, now serving as the brand's flagship SUV in most markets. Built on the Renault-Nissan Alliance's CMF-CD platform shared with the Nissan X-Trail and designed under the direction of Laurens van den Acker, the new Koleos adopted Renault's then-current design language with C-shaped LED lighting signatures, a prominent grille, and more sophisticated surfacing. Growing to 4.67 meters in length, the second-generation Koleos offered significantly more interior space while maintaining a five-seat configuration rather than adding a third row like some competitors. Engine options again varied by market but centered around a 2.0-liter dCi diesel and a 2.5-liter gasoline engine, with power outputs ranging from 130 to 175 horsepower. Transmission options included six-speed manual and X-Tronic continuously variable automatic, with both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations available depending on the engine and market. The interior quality improved dramatically with a more upscale design featuring a portrait-oriented 8.7-inch R-Link 2 touchscreen infotainment system on higher trims, along with available features including heated and ventilated leather seats, panoramic sunroof, Bose premium audio, and ambient lighting. Safety and driver assistance technology expanded to include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, emergency braking assist, and around-view monitor camera system. A facelift in 2019 introduced subtle styling updates, improved interior materials, and updated technology features including smartphone integration. While the second-generation Koleos has faced strong competition in the crowded mid-size SUV segment, it has established itself as a comfort-oriented, well-equipped option with distinctive styling, particularly appealing in markets where the Renault brand carries premium connotations."
